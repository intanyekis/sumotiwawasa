From the co-passenger who would not shut up to that first-timer who filled up a barf bag, or to that insensitive guy in front who reclines the chair all the way down to your knees as if he wants you to give him a shave, or that stupid kid behind you who would not stop kicking your chair. There are also countless stories of airline food that rivals hospital food, or flight attendants who do everything but attend to your needs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe you are just in the wrong airline. There are some who can provide you with some of the most luxurious accommodations similar to that of a five-star hotel. Below is a list of the top ten most elite airlines in the world.</p><h2 id=1-british-airways><b>1. British Airways</b></h2><p>At British Airways, you get taken cared of even before you take off. Its elegant lounges at the terminal offer those in the evening and late night flights a sumptuous dinner, thereby ensuring that you get to sleep inside the aircraft. It also has first class demi cabins that include workspaces, dens and spacious areas for rest and sleep. It has flat beds measuring 78 inches long. It also offers Molton Brown Travel Spa. And of course, the airline has always been known for it’s a la carte menu.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=2-cathay-pacific-airways-limited><b>2. Cathay Pacific Airways Limited</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It may not be that popular in the United States, but Cathay Pacific certainly provides luxurious accommodations in its aircrafts. The airline offers Elemis amenity kits and sleepwear that was designed by Shanghai Tang. Passengers also get several options for their audio and video entertainment. It also provides a five-course meal for long haul flights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=3-emirates><b>3. Emirates</b></h2><p>It does not matter what your entertainment preference is, what your favorite kinds of shows are, and what genres you want. Emirates airline surely has it all for you.

Eos Airlines</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Boeing 757 aircraft can accommodate up to 220 passengers. Eos Airlines reconfigured it so that only 48 passengers can get on board. You can just imagine the amount of space and room that each passenger would have. Actually, each one gets around 21 square feet of space, which is probably the size of a small studio in Manhattan.

Lufthansa Airlines</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When in Germany, make sure to fly Lufthansa especially in Frankfurt. The airline has its own terminal in the city. Once on board, first class passengers can have their fill of audio, video and games to entertain them through the Lufthansa Media World.

You can also do some duty free shopping on board. And as if these were not enough, you can also get limousine service upon arrival at your destination.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=10-virgin-atlantic><b>10. Virgin Atlantic</b></h2><p>Spoil yourself rotten when you fly Virgin Atlantic. The airline offers spacious beds that can be converted right out of the passenger’s seats.&nbsp; Overnight flights on its first class, or upper class, feature dimmed lights and minimal distractions, in what the airline calls a Snooze Zone.
