Ever since their honeymoon, the couple has failed to stay on the same page.&nbsp;</p><p>In this week's episode of 'Married At First Sight' Zach was reprimanded by Pastor Calvin Roberson for having floating opinions about his marriage and not taking any of it seriously. "Don't act like you're in a marriage, be in it," he said.</p><p>Although Zach tried his best to convince him that there's hope and would like to recommit to it, Pastor Cal was far from convinced. In his green-room interview, he even said that it appeared as though Zach wanted to further his modeling/acting career by being on the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Zach has been aloof and distant ever since the couple returned to Washington DC following their honeymoon in Panama. And that gap has only widened with time.</p><p>Making it worse is Zach's decision to not move in, not have enough conversations, and basically, just be in the marriage for the sake of it. This has hurt Mindy deeply, who is fully committed and willing to make it work.</p><p>Even when Zach moved in, she was thrilled and had prepared for a surprise for him. Earlier on, he had shared how he enjoyed chicken wings as snacks, Mindy remembered and ordered in a few boxes of it so that they could have a quick meal, some wine and a good, honest conversation with each other.</p><p>This was the first time they were together in the same room, sharing their routines and bed since their honeymoon. Because it had been a long time, Mindy insisted she will walk both his dogs while he got ready for the day. That way, they are not bumping into each other and both have enough time and space to prepare for the day ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>It was all going well, until Mindy asked Zach if he was ready to go to bed, secretly hoping that they would wake up next to each other. However, he flat-out rejected the idea by saying he'd like to sleep in the guest bedroom.</p><p>For Mindy to have accepted Zach was a bold move after he said he deleted the texts from the conversation he had with Lindsey, Mindy's friend.</p><p>She knew both Zach and Lindsey were lying to her face but was ready to believe Zach when he said he would go all in and start afresh, make their marriage work. Well, she is naive and also extremely optimistic. Let's hope she doesn't lose her sanity in all of the mess that Zach and Lindsey have cooked up in the past weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, fans believe Zach has slept with Lindsey with some even guessing that when he went to the other room, he called Lindsey up.&nbsp;</p><p>"#MarriedAtFirstSight Zach went in the other room to call Lindsey. You can't convince me otherwise," a fan wrote, while another shared: "Text. What’s App. FaceTime. However he could reach her, he did."</p><p>"Zach is a literal piece of shit and I’m willing to bet he slept with the friend &nbsp;#MarriedAtFirstSight," a user tweeted. "Zach can’t move in with Mindy because Lindsey Would Be Lonely Sleeping Without Him At Night #MarriedAtFirstSight #MAFS," another tweeted.</p><p>Catch all the new episodes of 'Married At First Sight' on Lifetime every Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopZGnv6qxw2aYrWWWnr%2B0wIysoKCgpGLHoq%2FHZqGuq6SesKZ5zKKlnbFdqLWqrsSnZKaZoqe2orPEZp2roZWjsW6yyLFkppmip7ais8RmnZqmo2K%2Fpq3CrQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-zach-justice-mindy-shiben-marriage-friend-fix-marriage-fans-react.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-zach-justice-mindy-shiben-marriage-friend-fix-marriage-fans-react.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-zach-justice-mindy-shiben-marriage-friend-fix-marriage-fans-react.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-zach-justice-mindy-shiben-marriage-friend-fix-marriage-fans-react.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-zach-justice-mindy-shiben-marriage-friend-fix-marriage-fans-react.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarried-at-first-sight-zach-justice-mindy-shiben-marriage-friend-fix-marriage-fans-react.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./famous-afro-latino-celebrities.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./famous-afro-latino-celebrities.html>Afro Latino Celebrities: Influential Figures</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
