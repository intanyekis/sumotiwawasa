"It's a tough thing when you have a lot of pressure with your family and living up to a name and an image. It's a lot of pressure. It's almost like you're pressured into having to be a musician, having to be an actor. It was good for him to go around the world and discover himself and have his own friends. You never know what triggers it. You never know…"</p><p>Benjamin looked incredibly similar to his grandfather; his mother, Lisa Marie Presley, even commented on their likeness. "Ben does look so much like Elvis. He was at the Opry and was the quiet storm behind the stage," she told CMT (via Hollywood Life). "Everybody turned around and looked when he was over there. Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-lisa-marie-presley-blame-herself-for-her-son-39-s-passing>Why Did Lisa Marie Presley Blame Herself For Her Son's Passing?</h2><p>Before her own tragic passing, Lisa Marie Presley shared an essay with People, giving fans a glimpse into the inner workings of her mind.

Still, she found it especially challenging when "the loss was premature, unnatural, or tragic, you will become a pariah in a sense. You can feel stigmatized and perhaps judged in some way as to why the tragic loss took place. This becomes magnetized by a million if you are the parent of a child who passed.
