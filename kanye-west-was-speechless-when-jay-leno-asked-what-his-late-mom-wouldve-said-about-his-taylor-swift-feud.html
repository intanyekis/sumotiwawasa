After the rapper was kicked out, <a href=#>the Renaissance artist</a> used her Video of the Year win to bring back Swift on stage and let her finish her speech.

When asked if he had a tough day, a remorseful Ye responded: "Yeah, it's been extremely difficult.

Before expressing his desire to apologize to Swift in person, he admitted: "I immediately knew in the situation that it was wrong, and it wasn't a spectacle [...] It's actually someone's emotions, you know, that I stepped on. It was rude."</p><p>Leno went on to ask what West's mom would have said about the scandal. The latter was speechless. The host followed up, "Would she be disappointed in this? Would she give you a lecture?," to which the Heartless performer replied: "Yeah, you know, obviously, I deal with hurt and so many celebrities they never take the time off and I've never taken the time off to [grieve]."</p><p>Holding back his tears, West said that he kept himself distracted, working on "music after music." Relating his loss to his VMAs meltdown, he said he was "ashamed my hurt caused someone else's hurt." He clarified that he wasn't trying to justify his actions but that it made him realize he needs to "take some time off and just analyze how I'm gonna make it through the rest of this life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Leno noticed West struggling to answer further as he choked on his tears, so he wrapped the chat and thanked him for doing the interview.

During the fashion show, he played his new album The Life of Pablo which featured the song Famous where he raps: "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that b*tch famous."</p><p>The very next day, a rep for the Lavender Haze singer said that "Kanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single Famous on her Twitter account. She declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message. Taylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, 'I made that b*tch famous.'"</p><p>In June that year, West's then-wife <strong><a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a></strong> joined in on the drama, arguing that Swift "totally knew that that was coming out" on her first-ever GQ cover.
