Although he suffered from a congenital deformity in three fingers of his left hand, he became a drummer and also studied tap dancing. He started his career in acting while studying in high school, acting with the BelfRy Players in Wisconsin. He first earned fame as he portrayed the title role in the play “You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown” in 1967.

He made his feature film debut in 1970 playing the role of Radar O’Reilly in the movie “M*A*S*H”. He continued his role as Radar in the television series of the same name and became the only person in the movie as a regular cast in the series. For his role as Radar O’Reilly in the series, he was nominated for six Emmy Awards, winning one in 1977 in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. The award was accepted by Gary’s co-star&nbsp;Alan Alda&nbsp;on his behalf.</p><p>Apart from the “M*A*S*H” television series, Gary appeared in several more television shows marking his prominence on the small screen. Notably, he appeared in game shows like “Tattletales”, “Showoffs” and “Hollywood Squares” and in television series like “W*A*L*T*E*R”, “The New Adventures Of Wonder Woman” and several more. Gary worked with actors like Joanna Cameron, Peter Kastner, and Louise Sorel in the movie “B.S. I Love You”.</p><p>Gary retired from acting in 2010, but being a part of all these film and TV projects has earned well for Gary Burghoff allowing him to lead his life as a multi-millionaire artist.</p><p>Gary Burghoff is a divorcee and the father of his three children.
