It was this friendship that opened the door to her being cast in the hit HBO mini-series.</p><p>"It was January of 2020. And Oscar Isaac — who’s my friend of 20 years; we went to college together — emailed me and said, 'I just had a meeting. They’re doing an adaptation of Scenes From a Marriage. I really wanna do this with you. I’m not attached yet, but are you available?'" Jessica explained.</p><p>While her year was already "pretty booked" due to being in a play on the West End called "A Doll's House". While she reached out asking if the production would postpone until she was available, she never heard back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Then comes COVID. A Doll’s House gets postponed, and I’m suddenly very free. But by then they’d already cast [Michelle Williams]. In October, I got another email from Oscar that was like, 'Listen, as you recall, you were the first person I reached out to. The actress who was gonna do it fell out. Please, can I send you the scripts?' I read the scripts, and I loved them. We started secret rehearsals three days later."</p><h2 id=why-jessica-chastain-wanted-to-make-the-new-version-of-scenes-from-a-marriage>Why Jessica Chastain Wanted To Make The New Version Of Scenes From A Marriage</h2><p>There are a few notable differences between the two versions of Scenes From A Marriage. One being the reversal of the role the husband and wife play. This was one of the main reasons why Jessica wanted to make it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The reason I thought it could work is that it explores gender in a relationship in that time period; I love that ours explores gender in a relationship in 2020. Now the woman is the breadwinner. What does that mean when she comes home?" Jessica asked.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jessica Chastain Had Strong Feelings About Florence Pugh's 'Revealing' Dress</a></span></p><p>"In our situation, she doesn’t want to emasculate her husband, so she makes herself as small as she can be at home so he can be the king, which is why he talks so much and is, like, ruling the house. But if you have to make yourself smaller in a relationship, it will always come back to haunt you.

I was like, 'What?!' And he goes, 'Yeah, I just thought she made so many mistakes.' I was like, 'Wow, that’s a man’s perspective.' I wonder if men will say, 'You should have been nicer to Oscar Isaac.'"</p><h2 id=jessica-chastain-and-oscar-isaac-39-s-intimate-scenes-in-scenes-from-a-marriage>Jessica Chastain And Oscar Isaac's Intimate Scenes In Scenes From A Marriage</h2><p>The NSFW scenes in Scenes From A Marriage were so spicy that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar Isaac even trended on Twitter because of them</a>.

There was no wall between us. We joke he’s my work husband. I could tell immediately if someone said something and it bothered him. At the beginning, we read episode four and I got emotional from reading it. In public, you put on your persona; you don’t want to be a wreck. But I was deeply affected by the read. Oscar looked at me and goes, 'You okay, Jess?' And I was like [gasps]. He could see I was in a tough place where nobody else in the room could tell. That’s the curse part. Because I was like, Okay, I’m about to go on this journey with this scene partner who I can’t hide anything from. He’s like a microscope with me. It makes the work better but more terrifying because sometimes you want some space. You’re like, I don’t want you to be able to read my thoughts every moment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We hope you enjoyed reading this article!
