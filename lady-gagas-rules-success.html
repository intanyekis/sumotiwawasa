Her dedication to remaining kind, considerate, and generous has made her a leader in philanthropy and hugely positive as a role model to her fans.</p><p>"We bring people together to have real, honest conversations and to be kind. It is not an afterthought to our work. It is the driving power for everything we do. It is the lens we view every challenge through.

"I've worked hard for a long time, and it's not about winning—but what it's about is not giving up."</p><p>"If you have a dream, fight for it," she continued. "There's a discipline for passion. And it's not about how many times you get rejected, or you fall, or you're beaten up. It's about how many times you stand up, and are brave, and you keep on going."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-persistent>She is Persistent</h2><p>After injuring herself during The Monster Ball tour, Gaga was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnosed</a> with synovitis, an inflammation of the joints, and a gruesome labral tear.
