Just one exampleâ€”"At the end of the day, you won't be happy until you love yourself," Lady Gaga <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> during a speech.

However, Lady Gaga's <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">readiness</a> to take risks and continuously rethink her musical style and image has helped define her as an unstoppable creative force.</p><h2 id=she-values-her-family>She Values Her Family</h2><p>Its no secret that staying grounded is a formidable challenge for superstars.

Her dedication to remaining kind, considerate, and generous has made her a leader in philanthropy and hugely positive as a role model to her fans.</p><p>"We bring people together to have real, honest conversations and to be kind. It is not an afterthought to our work. It is the driving power for everything we do. It is the lens we view every challenge through. It is framing the way we put everything around every possible solution. To me, almost every problem you can think of can be solved with kindness," Gaga <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> as she received the Children Mending Heart's 10th annual Empathy Rocks awards for her work with the foundation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-breaks-boundaries>She Breaks Boundaries</h2><p>From her unique fashion choices to her genre-bending and blending music, Lady Gaga has never failed to excite her fans and capture the public imagination.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Emmys 2019: 5 Best Dressed & 5 Riskiest Outfits, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Her impact on the world of pop is profound.

"I've worked hard for a long time, and it's not about winningâ€”but what it's about is not giving up."</p><p>"If you have a dream, fight for it," she continued. "There's a discipline for passion. And it's not about how many times you get rejected, or you fall, or you're beaten up. It's about how many times you stand up, and are brave, and you keep on going."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-persistent>She is Persistent</h2><p>After injuring herself during The Monster Ball tour, Gaga was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diagnosed</a> with synovitis, an inflammation of the joints, and a gruesome labral tear.
