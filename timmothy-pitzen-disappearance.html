The incident has a lot of people concerned and raised many questions.</p><p>Find out what happened when Amy took his son from school and drove him somewhere they couldn’t get back from.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Timmothy Pitzen?</h2><p>Born in Aurora on October 18th, 2004, Timothy was the only child Jim Pitzen, and Amy Joan Marie Fry-Pitzen had. They were living in residence together in one of the states of the US, which is Illinois.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened to Amy and Timothy?</h2><p>In the morning of May 11th, 2011, Jim Pitzen, Timothy’s father, dropped his kid off at Greenman Elementary in Aurora, Illinois, for kindergarten.</p><p>Jim stood there, watching his playful son rush toward his kindergarten teacher, swinging his Spider-Man bag.</p><p>Timothy’s mother, Amy, arrived at the school around 30 minutes later and signed him out of school at 8:30 a.m. that morning, alleging a family emergency to school employees.</p><p>James Pitzen said in his interview with People Magazine, “I told him I loved him and to be good.” “And then he was gone,” he added.</p><p>Mr. Pitzen was unaware of his wife’s conduct and was startled to discover Timmothy missing when he returned to his son’s school later afterward to pick him up.</p><p>Pitzen discovered that his wife had checked Timmothy out of class in the school logbook. He attempted loads of times to contact her, but she did not respond or accept his calls.</p><p>James double-checked the home and Amy’s workplace. He dialed her number, but it went to voicemail because she was not answering.</p><p>Jim then reported his wife Amy and son Timothy missing the very next morning, on May 12th, 2011.</p><p>Amy and Timothy were last seen leaving the school about 8:30 a.m., according to security footage.</p><p>When Amy Fry-Pitzen drove away with her son Timothy, a few hours later, she was located at a local workshop to fix her car maybe.</p><p>At 10:00 a.m., Amy dropped her car off at a repair shop. Fry-Pitzen and her son were driven to the Brookfield Zoo by a shop worker.&nbsp;</p><p>Later at 3:00 p.m., they returned and picked up their car, then went to the KeyLime Cove Resort in Gurnee, where they stayed the night, without letting Jim Petizen know.</p><p>According to the sources, Amy and her son, Timmothy, arrived at Kalahari Resort in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, on May 12th, 2011.</p><p><br>Then they both were caught on surveillance camera in the checkout queue at 10:00 a.m. the following morning. Along with SUV, both Amy and Timmothy, have been missing since then.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Before They Went Missing</h2><p>Although Amy didn’t answer Jim’s calls, instead, she actually contacted her mother.&nbsp;</p><p>She assured her mother that they were OK and that they will be back in a day or two. She said that all she needed was some breathing room.</p><p>She also dialed Jim’s brother’s number. According to True Crime Daily, she also informed him all was great, and then she told Jim’s brother that Timmothy belonged to him only.</p><p>Jim told True Crime Daily, “Timmothy was following mom.” “Timmothy was on the floor, playing with what looked like a semi-truck.” Timmothy was happy and didn’t seem to have any distress or anything.”</p><p>In the past, the <a href=#>relationship</a> of Amy and Jim was suffering quite a lot because of Amy’s mental health problems.</p><p>Amy Fry-Pitzen and James Pitzen met through mutual friends at a party and had a year-long long-distance affair. Fry-Pitzen battled with depression.</p><p>Especially when her first marriage ended, but Pitzen was certain that by building a healthy connection and situation, he could assist her.</p><p>Fry-Pitzen, on the other hand, tried suicide in 2003, passing out and falling over the side of a cliff.</p><p>Fry-Pitzen was expecting in 2004 and then got married to Jim before Timmothy was born.&nbsp;</p><p>Pitzen claims that they regularly fought over money and his wife’s habit of traveling with buddies.</p><p>They had an argument before dropping their son at kindergarten. It was regarding not informing Jim whilst Amy was with her friends, partying the whole night.</p><p>Timmothy and his mother Amy were last spotted together checking out from the Kalahari resort in Wisconsin, on May 13th, 2011.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Disappearance of Timmothy Pitzen</h2><p>Amy Fry-Pitzen was seen on security footage in a grocery shop in Rockford, Illinois, approximately after 8 p.m. that night, when she was alone. Timmothy was not visible in any of the footage.</p><p>Amy was spotted buying a notebook, envelopes, and pen from the grocery store before she returned to the hotel.</p><p>Then, Amy checked into the Motel named Rockford Inn in Rockford, Illinois, around 11:15 p.m., where she committed suicide by cutting her wrists and throat and overdosing on antihistamines later that night.</p><p>It was around 12:30 p.m., a hotelkeeper almost freaked out when found Amy’s body lying on bed and saw a note on May 14, 2011. The knife Fry-Pitzen used to commit suicide contained just her blood, Timmothy was not there.</p><p>Fry-Pitzen apologised for the shambles she had made in the note and indicated that Timmothy would never be found, but that he was safe with people who would look after him.</p><p>Prior to her suicide and Timmothy’s disappearance, she had threatened separation.</p><p><strong>Police were able to track Amy’s whereabouts using forensics from her SUV</strong></p><p>Amy’s SUV was found near the highway by the police. Timmothy’s bag and toys were missing, and “a concerning amount” of blood recovered in her SUV belonged to Timmothy, according to police.&nbsp;</p><p>A family member then stated that the bloodstains were most probably caused by a nosebleed Timmothy had earlier in the month during a ride. The case was pending.</p><p>The story made global headlines again in 2019 when a 14-year-old boy claiming to be Timmothy resurfaced in the Cincinnati, Ohio, region.</p><p>According to the FBI, a DNA test eventually revealed that the youngster in issue was not the missing child.</p><p>For making a fraudulent claim, a federal judge sentenced the Ohio man, Rini, to two years in prison and one year on probation in 2020.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Case Reopened</h2><p>According to James Pitzen, he feels Timmothy is still alive. On August 25th of 2018, the case was presented on the American television show Live PD.</p><p>The show had guest Angeline Hartmann of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who gave viewers an age progression photo of 13-year-old Timmothy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Timmothy Pitzen in 2021</h2><p>Timmothy Pitzen still hasn’t been traced ten years later, as his mother predicted, and the unsolved mystery affects his father literally every minute of each day.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunDAyKakqKyYrnqxtdOznKdllJ7AorzPnpirmZ6YsnA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftimmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftimmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftimmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftimmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftimmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftimmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./apryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./apryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html>The Messy Truth About Apryl Jones, Lil' Fizz, And Omarion's Love Triangle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./robin-arzon-net-worth-2020-husband-salary-spouse-married-pregnant-height-birthday-biography-wiki.html>Robin Arzon Net Worth, Husband, Salary, Spouse, Married, Pregnant, Height, Birthday, Biography, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./robin-arzon-net-worth-2020-husband-salary-spouse-married-pregnant-height-birthday-biography-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
