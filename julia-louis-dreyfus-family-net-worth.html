However, considering that Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her husband Brad Hall are <strong>worth a combined $260 million</strong>, it is clear that she deserves to be listed among huge stars like that as well.</p><p>Easily one of the most successful comedy actors of her generation, at times it has seemed like Julia Louis-Dreyfus has the Midas touch. After all, unlike the vast majority of actors who’ve starred in an iconic show, Louis-Dreyfus has starred in more than one sitcom that will go down in history as an all-time great. In fact, she played such a key role in the success of her latest show that its production came to a complete halt when she couldn’t appear on set through no fault of her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once you examine Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ career as a whole, it makes sense that she is a very wealthy person.

As such, the actor has nothing scheduled to release until 2025 when she appears in the film, "Thunderbolts" which is currently in production. Given the success of the other Marvel movies that Louis-Dreyfus has appeared in over the years, she likely will be making a fantastic salary <strong>reprising her role of Valentina Allegra de Fontaine</strong>, which will just be added to the massive fortune she already has.</p><h2 id=julia-louis-dreyfus-39-husband>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Husband</h2><h3 id=julia-louis-dreyfus-39-husband-brad-hall-is-worth-10-million>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' husband Brad Hall, is worth $10 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/julia-louis-dreyfus-brad-hall-2015-emmys-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whenever Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her husband Brad Hall appear at a red-carpet event, there is no doubt that she is the one who commands almost all the attention. Despite that, Brad Hall actually has accomplished a lot more in the entertainment industry than most people in the business, which is why <strong>his net worth is $10 million</strong>.</p><p>After Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Brad Hall met and fell in love at Northwestern University, they <strong>both were hired to be a part of Saturday Night Live </strong>in the early-‘80s. While most SNL fans seem to have completely forgotten Brad Hall was a part of the show, he landed one of the most coveted gigs of all when he became <strong>a Weekend Update anchor</strong>. For that reason, Hall has something in common with some of the most beloved SNL stars of all time.</p><p>Brad Hall has also created shows like The Single Guy and he was a writer, producer and director on the show Brooklyn Bridge.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/this-seinfeld-guest-star-got-sick-after-kissing-julia-louis-dreyfus-but-revealed-_it-was-worth-it_-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>This Seinfeld Guest-Star Got Sick After Kissing Julia Louis-Dreyfus, But Revealed "It Was Worth It"</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Julia Louis-Dreyfus got a certain Seinfeld guest-star sick, but it was worth it given that the actor had a secret crush on the star.</span><h2 id=julia-louis-dreyfus-39-family-business>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Family Business</h2><h3 id=julia-louis-dreyfus-39-family-business-the-louis-dreyfus-company-is-worth-120-billion>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' family business, the Louis Dreyfus Company is worth $120 billion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/julia-louis-dreyfus-at-the-2022-premiere-of-downhill.jpg><p>Long before Julia Louis-Dreyfus was born, her great-great-grandfather Léopold Louis-Dreyfus founded the Louis Dreyfus Company. While most people have never heard of it, the Louis Dreyfus Company’s annual <strong>gross sales have exceeded $120 billion</strong>.</p><p>Since Léopold Louis-Dreyfus passed away in 1915, his fortune and interests in the company he founded have been passed down in Julia’s family. For example, before Julia’s father Gérard Louis-Dreyfus passed away in 2016, he chaired the Louis Dreyfus Company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the company's success, Gérard reportedly was able to <strong>amass a $4 billion net worth</strong> before he passed away which was inherited by Julia, her siblings, and her step-mother. For that reason, it has been suggested that Julia Louis-Dreyfus is likely to become a billionaire in the future.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52354318-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus Reveals Her Unexpected Reaction To Breast Cancer Diagnosis</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The actress said she had a surprising reaction upon getting the life-changing phone call from her doctor.</span><h2 id=julia-louis-dreyfus-39-incredible-career>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' Incredible Career</h2><h3 id=julia-louis-dreyfus-39-acting-career-has-made-her-a-250-million-fortune>Julia Louis-Dreyfus' acting career has made her a $250 million fortune</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/julia-louis-dreyfus-1.jpg><p>Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a <strong>current net worth of $250 million</strong>, which makes her one of the <a href=# rel=nofollow>wealthiest Seinfeld stars</a>. While it is clear that Brad Hall and Louis-Dreyfus’ forebearers have contributed a lot of money to her family’s fortune, she has made a big chunk of her family’s fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Still best known as one of the stars of the legendary sitcom Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus played a massive role in that show’s years of success. For proof of this, all you have to do is tune into an episode and observe how hilarious Julia was at every turn. Alternatively, you could watch Seinfeld’s pilot in which Elaine Benes doesn’t appear since her character was created after that episode was filmed. Unsurprisingly, that episode simply doesn’t work the same way due to Louis-Dreyfus’ absence.</p><p>This is also seen in the money that Louis-Dreyfus made from the show. The breakdown of her salary over the years includes:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Season</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Salary</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>One</p></td><td><p>$20,000 per episode</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Two</p></td><td><p>Unknown</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Three</p></td><td><p>Unknown</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Four</p></td><td><p>Unknown</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Five</p></td><td><p>$150,000 per episode</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Six</p></td><td><p>$150,000 per episode</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Seven</p></td><td><p>$150,000 per episode</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Eight</p></td><td><p>$150,000 per episode</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nine</p></td><td><p>$600,000 per episode</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Seinfeld came to an end, Michael Richards and Jason Alexander tried to find new sitcoms to star in but fans didn’t accept them in their new roles. While that doesn’t say anything bad about those two actors, Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s fans have remained loyal as she has found new roles. For example, from 2006 until 2010 she starred in The New Adventures of Old Christine and the show enjoyed a great deal of success.</p><p>Once The New Adventures of Old Christine came to an end, Julia Louis-Dreyfus hit gold once again when she agreed to star in Veep. Easily among the most acclaimed shows of the last decade, Veep was a huge hit with audiences and viewers alike. Since Veep was such a huge success and Julia was its main star, she managed to <strong>negotiate a $500,000 per episode deal</strong> to star in it, making millions in the process.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihrqSZlnqtu9SiqmacoprGp8HSZp2apZmhxm66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjulia-louis-dreyfus-family-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjulia-louis-dreyfus-family-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjulia-louis-dreyfus-family-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjulia-louis-dreyfus-family-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjulia-louis-dreyfus-family-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjulia-louis-dreyfus-family-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sean-parker-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sean-parker-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Sean Parker Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eiza-gonzalez-gq-mexico-cover-pic.html>Eiza Gonzalezs Scantily Clad GQ Mexico Cover See Her Sexy Shoot Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eiza-gonzalez-gq-mexico-cover-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
