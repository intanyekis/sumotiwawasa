Us Weekly confirmed that the pair are dating in May, one week after the comedian confirmed to Us he had split from his wife of six years, Anna Marie Tendler.</p><footer><a href=../../john-mulaney-and-olivia-munn-enjoy-lunch-date-in-los-angeles.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../juliette-goglia-net-worth.html>Juliette Goglia Net Worth</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

The Iron Order club insists it is a law-abiding, charitable brotherhood of family men who just like to ride.

そして、現在も2002年に生まれた息子・志門（しおん）と３人家族で松濤の豪邸に住み続けております。購入から20年以上も住んでるということになりますね。
松濤というエリアは、渋谷のクランブル交差点からすぐ行けるということで、渋谷に行く度に稲葉さんの自宅を一目見に行くというファンの方も多いです。
今更？と思いますが、稲葉浩志さんと嫁さんが結婚以来ずっと住み続けている渋谷区松濤の豪邸の情報を書いてみたいです。
稲葉浩志の渋谷区松濤の自宅。豪邸の住所と外観[画像] 渋谷の松濤というエリアは都内屈指の高級住宅街で、長年安定して数億を稼げるクラスの人ではないと住めない土地です。
渋谷というと「若者の街」のイメージが強いですが、少し歩くと松濤のような閑静な住宅街が出現するのです。
稲葉浩志さんの豪邸は色鮮やかな石に覆われており、カラフルな巨大な円形の物体があるので目立ちます。
上空写真だとこのような感じです。
見てわかる通りに自宅の正面は行き止まりです。
さりげなく目の前を通ろうとすれば行き止まりで引き返すことになるので、「なんだあいつは？」と家覗きに来たのバレバレで恥ずかしいので気をつけましょう。
たまに警備員がいるタイミングもあるみたいなので、変なことをしに行くと捕まるので遠慮しましょう。
チラッと見るのであれば、自宅の近くに自販機があるので、そこでジュースを買って売り上げに貢献しましょう。
値段7億の豪邸の広さ。表札には「ストーンハウス」 ちなみに稲葉浩志さんの松濤の豪邸は1998年当時に5〜7億円で建てたそうです。
地上2階、地下1階の構造で、広さはザッと130坪ある豪邸です。
自宅にはスタジオも完備されていて、最近はそのスタジオで歌う姿が公開されました。
クラシックな渋い雰囲気が伝わってきます。
住んで20年以上経っているので稲葉さんなりのこだわりがフル装備されていることでしょう。
ちなみに松濤の自宅の表札は「稲葉」ではなく、「STONEHOUSE」と書かれています。
なにかのカモフラージュなのか、遊びなのか、意図がわかりません。
稲葉浩志と嫁・子供は自宅近所で犬の散歩？目撃談無数 渋谷区の高級住宅街「松濤」に20年以上住んでる稲葉浩志さん。過去、目撃情報はいくらでもあります。
週刊誌に嫁さんや子供といる姿が載せられることもあれば、ネット上で目撃談が載せられることもあります。
近所の方々とは団結してることでしょうし、余計なことは言わないはずですが、週刊誌に載る頻度は凄まじいです。
稲葉さんとの遭遇を狙ってるファンのほとんどが犬の散歩をしてる時間帯でありますが、実際に見かけたら話しかけることもできないのが関の山だと思います。
長男の志門くんは幼稚園は近所の松濤幼稚園だったとの噂なので、近所にパパ友・ママ友はたくさんいると思うので、あまり不審なことをしてると地元ネットワークが動くので注意しましょう。
過去に稲葉浩志が散歩の格好でスクランブル交差点で自撮り 稲葉浩志さんが自宅を構える松濤から渋谷のスクランブル交差点までは歩いて行ける距離です。
過去に稲葉浩志さんがB'zのインスタグラムにて自身で自撮り写真をアップし、大きな話題となりました。
公式インスタでは、１日に「ＣｈｅｃｋｏｕｔｔｈｅｂｉｌｌｂｏａｒｄｉｎＳｈｉｂｕｙａ！！」と広告の写真を投稿。２日には、「ＨｅｒｅＩａｍ！」とのコメントとともに、自撮りをする稲葉の写真が投稿された。
インスタのコメント欄には「まさか渋谷に現れるとは」「なんと、ご本人が降臨とは…」「ビックリし過ぎて何も言えない」と驚きの声が多く寄せられた。そして「稲葉さんが自撮りしてる～」「え、自撮り？え、自撮り？愛おしいっ」と、自撮りをする稲葉に歓喜するファンたち。また、「えええ今から行くのに！ニアミス！」「えーーーーっ今！？私昨日そこにいたのに～」と遭遇できずに落ち込む声も見られた。
ヘアセットもメイクもされていないので完全にプライベートだと思います。
おそらく、いつもの日常の一環ですね。松濤の近所にはお店がないので、ここら辺まで行って買い物してる可能性は大です。
兵庫県芦屋の別荘は長戸大幸の所有。稲葉浩志の自宅ではない 稲葉浩志さんは兵庫県の高級住宅街・芦屋の一頭地に別荘を持っていると噂されていました。
建物の規模が凄まじく、松濤の豪邸よりも何倍も高級感がある建物です。
上空写真を見るとテニスコートがあることがわかります。稲葉浩志さんは学生時代にテニス部で活躍し現在も試合に足を運ぶほどのテニスファンなので納得ですね。
そして真上から見ると音符の形になっているという素敵な世界観であります。
敷地面積900坪で建設費約9億円とも言われる豪邸にはスタジオも完備されており、一時期は稲葉浩志さんが出入りする姿が頻繁に目撃されていました。
B'zが関西地方でライブをすると、稲葉さんがこの別荘をホテル代わりに使用していたそうです。
ただ、建物の所有者は稲葉浩志さんではなくて、長戸大幸さんの接待用の豪邸との説が濃厚です。
近頃は稲葉さんの目撃談もなくなり、人気もなくなったということで、すでに売却されているとの噂があります。
芦屋の別荘はGARNET CROWの「君の思い描いた夢 集メル HEAVEN」のPVで確認できる？ 内装も豪華だと言われている芦屋のこちらの建物ですが、過去にミュージシャンのM Vにも使われたことがあるそうです。
男女4人組バンド・GARNET CROW（ガーネット・クロウ）が2005年のシングル「君の思い描いた夢 集メル HEAVEN」のPV撮影に使ったそうです。
まるで高級ブランドショップの内装のようなセンス。
豪華はもちろんですが、そのオシャレ度に度肝うを抜かれます。
GARNET CROWは、Ading（アディング）というビーインググループの傘下レーベルGIZA studioのマネージメントオフィスだったこともあり、長戸大幸さんの豪邸を使用したのかもしれません。
