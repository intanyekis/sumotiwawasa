The tribute came after the same episode La Brea also lost a beloved character on screen.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>La Brea</a> is NBC’s Science-fiction drama series that follows a group of people who are pulled into the depths of a massive sinkhole that opens in the middle of the area around the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California. After they’re pulled into the sinkhole, the survivors find themselves in a mysterious and dangerous prehistoric land where they must band together to survive.</p><p>The series, which premiered in 2021, is set to end with its third and final season in 2024. “It’s definitely bittersweet. It’s been such an amazing journey,” creator David Appelbaum told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a> in January 2024 of <a href=# rel=noopener>La Brea‘s cancellation</a>. “I’ve been working on this for four and a half years and there were so many challenges and so much time and effort put into it. There’s something sad about seeing something that you love so much ending, but at the same time, I feel really proud of how we’re able to wrap things up and really give the audience an emotionally cathartic ending for these characters that they care about.</p><p>La Brea will end with its series finale on Tuesday, February 13. In the penultimate episode, the series saw two devastating deaths both on and off screen in crew member Peter Muston and original character Levi Delgado. Viewers already know Levi from the first three seasons of the series, but who is <a href=# rel=noopener>Peter Muston from La Brea</a>? Read on for the La Brea crew member who was honored at the end of Season 3, Episode 5, and how he died.</p><h2>Who was Peter Muston on La Brea?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/La-Brea-2.jpg alt="La Brea" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who was Peter Muston from La Brea? Muston was honored in a title card at the end of La Brea Season 3, Episode 5, “The Road Home, Part 1.” “In Loving Memory of Peter Muston,” the slide read. But who was Peter Muston? Muston was a production manager on La Brea and worked on 20 episodes of the series from 2021 to 2023, according to his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">IMDb</a>. Along with production management, Muston also worked as a producer and location manager on shows like With Intent, Outland, Bed of Roses, Rush, and Satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Muston died on October 11, 2023 at Alfred Hospial in Melbourne, Australia, from complications following a cardiac arrest. He was 64 years old. “Vale Peter Muston Musty was our Production Manager on Deadloch and what a fun, warm, lovely human being he was,” Kate McLennan — a co-creator on the Prime Video show Deadloch, which Muston worked as a production manager on — wrote in an Insagram post at the time of his death.</p><p>She continued, “We’ll never forget how he took time out from the demands of shooting to be involved in this very silly, but utterly perfect brother sister portrait. He was just wonderful. Our hearts go out to his family and nearest and dearest.”</p><p>Muston’s friend, Mark Johnson, confirmed his death at the time and described the late producer as a “big-hearted, witty, funny, dry-humoured guy who was loved and respected by many people,” per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">If.com.au</a>. Johnson continued, “While life often finds us seeing less of those we regard as true friends, that physical distance does not lessen the bond that for me, existed since we were in primary school together.”</p><p>According to the website, Muston, who is originally from Sydney, Australia, started his television career as a location manager on the drama Stingers, which was set in Melbourne, in the 1990s. He then moved to production management in the 2010s with the drama Offspring. He started as a production manager from Seasons 1 to 2 before he was promoted to a line producer in Season 3 to 5. Muston is survived by his partner, Deb; his daughters Alice and Tilly; and his sisters Kerry and Jo.</p><p>La Brea executive producer and director Adam Davidson was also among those who honored Muston after his death. “He was in a class unto himself: smart, funny, reasonable, charming, gentlemanly, erudite, and a friend to all,” he said, per If.com.au, adding that he was “so grateful” to work with Muston on La Brea. He continued, “I always noticed the ways in which whomever he was dealing with he showed them respect and kindness, listened to them, and approached them in a way that made it clear he was there to help. There was always a lot to learn from him and how he handled things.”</p><h2>What happened to Levi on La Brea?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Levi-La-Brea.jpg alt="Levi - La Brea" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Peter Muston was honored on La Brea in the same episode the series — which is set to end with its third season in February 2024 — lost one of its original characters. Levi Delgado (played by Nicholas Gonzalez) died in La Brea Season 3, Episode 5 after he sacrifices himself to save Gavin and Izzy, while also telling them where they can find Eve, Izzy’s mother and Gavin’s estranged wife.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TV Insider</a>, Gonzalez revealed that moment wasn’t originally how Levi was supposed to die in La Brea. “A lot changed a few times,” he said. Initially, once everyone was brought back for a shortened third season (in anticipation of the strikes, which did happen), he was told he was probably only going to be in one episode. “I guess it had always been the plan for Levi to die, probably because I was playing the character because all my characters die for some reason.”</p><p>Gonzalez told TV Insider that, he thought Levi would be killed in Season 5, Episode 1 after a conversation with creator David Appelbaum. He also expected to die early in the season knowing that fans wanted to see the Harris family, a.k.a. couple Eve and Gavin, back together. “[There’s] a certain point where other than the mea culpas and Levi saying it’s my fault and what can I do and I want to get this family back together—he’s betrayed so much in trying to keep things to himself, going for revenge last season—what’s next?” he said of his death. “I just felt like that this was kind of right.”</p><p>As for filming Levi’s death, Eoin Macken, who plays Gavin, described the scene as “actually really sad.” He continued, “I think, for myself and Nick as friends. It meant he wouldn’t be there for the last couple of weeks filming in Australia, and Nick is a person that I love and adore, and we get on very well. That, I think, fed into the characters a little bit, so the characters always trusted each other even though we were having that [conflict]. And I think you can see that, especially in Season 3, they cared about each other. So us filming that scene was actually sad for the two of us because we knew that the show was coming to an end. We knew that we weren’t going to work together as characters anymore.”</p><p>Gonzalez added, “These guys had been through so many missions together, and that never goes away. I think that there’s a certain respect, there’s an understanding there. His death wasn’t the time to put anything in his face about what they had done. So much had gone wrong. They had both done things, but they get it.”</p><p>Gonzalez also explained “why Levi ultimately died” to push the story in La Brea forward for the series finale. “There was a lot of pity involved. There was a scene, I think, that’s cut from the first episode of Season 3 where we see Levi’s hurt from the explosion at the village,” he said “He’s by himself, and Ty [Chiké Okonkwo] comes to check on him, and you get that he’s just a shell. Nobody wants him around anymore. …We have a real moment where I say, well, look, if Levi’s not going to take his own life, then he’s going to lay it down to make sure he’s going to bring that family that he tore apart back together. But that death, I’m so happy that there were so many layers to it.”</p><p>He continued, “I just really hope that that emotion sans melodrama is there because they really loved each other, Gavin and Levi, despite everything. And I think his gift to them, too, is he kind of goes out with a smile, or at least that was one of my plans, that there’s a calming kind of, ‘Don’t worry about me. I’ve had my time, and I did what I needed to do. Now go, be together, save her.’”</p><p>La Brea is available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Peacock</a>.</p><p><strong>Check out our gallery below on who <a href=# rel=noopener>primetime stars are dating and married to in real life</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYWx9dH2OqZytnaJiura%2F06ilZqSRYq%2BzscBo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeter-muston-la-brea.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpeter-muston-la-brea.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpeter-muston-la-brea.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpeter-muston-la-brea.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeter-muston-la-brea.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeter-muston-la-brea.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bb-king-htm.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bb-king-htm.html>BB King - Bio, Age, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./r-truth.html>R-Truth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./r-truth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
