<time>06 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><a href=#>Fans of Emily in Paris</a> will immediately recognize the name Camille Razat as the lovely and sophisticated Camille, one of the first people in Paris who befriends Emily and is Gabriel's on-and-off girlfriend. And while the relationship between Camille and Emily has dramatically shifted over the course of three seasons, the two are always in one another's lives, for better or worse. A dynamic that keeps audiences on their toes and keeps them coming back to see how the drama unfolds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before becoming a part of the hit Netflix show, Razat was not a well-known name in the US. While she has been involved in the entertainment industry for years in France, being cast in the role of Camille has given the model an opportunity to introduce herself to a completely new audience. With that opportunity comes a larger payday as well. And because of this, Razat's net worth has dramatically risen since <a href=#>joining the cast of </a><a href=#>Emily in Paris</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'Emily In Paris' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Here is what Camille Razat's net worth is after Emily in Paris.</p><h2 id=how-camille-razat-landed-the-role-of-camille-in-emily-in-paris>How Camille Razat Landed The Role Of Camille In Emily In Paris</h2><p>While Razat has been in the entertainment industry for nearly a decade, her performances on the big and small screen have been kept to France.</p><p>However, the networking during that time paid off as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the casting director for Emily in Paris was someone that Razat had known for 10 years</a>. Because of this, she was invited to audition for the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar52260386.jpg><p>Just because Razat was invited to audition did not mean she was automatically given the part. In fact, she almost was not in the running for it.</p><p>"The first time that I did go to my audition I was so sick," Razat explained. "I had fever, and I was, like, so slow."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where You May Have Seen The Cast Of Emily In Paris Before</a></span></p><p>Razat knew that she had bungled her first audition and asked if she could come back to do it again when she was feeling better. But much to her surprise, producers were not upset with what they saw, especially "from someone who's sick."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The decent first-round audition put Razat in a pool with other actresses who had moved on to the next audition. And finally, after several more rounds of auditions, Razat was offered the role of Camille.</p><h2 id=what-camille-razat-was-doing-before-playing-camille>What Camille Razat Was Doing Before Playing Camille</h2><p>Before playing Camille, Razat was making her name known as an actress. But she was not brand new to being in front of the camera by any stretch. This is because before making the jump into acting, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Razat had been a model since the age of 14</a>.</p><p>In order to make the big money in modeling, women need to be considered supermodels. The models that are on demand to walk in every designer's show, be in print, and even be spokesmodels. But this does not happen for most working models. Instead, if they are lucky, they make a living that allows them to live comfortably.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Razat was making an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">average modeling salary in France</a>, she would be making in the neighborhood of €42,017. This equates to roughly $45,000 USD.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Are Begging Ashley Park To Stop Singing In Emily In Paris</a></span></p><p>Along with modeling, Razat was beginning to land roles consistently on both television and film in the years leading up to being cast on Emily in Paris. With roles in The 15:17 To Paris and Disparue, Razat was getting the exposure she needed to be considered to audition for larger roles.</p><p>But nothing compared to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">roles she is being offered now that she has become an "A-list" actress</a>, thanks to being recognized as Camille.</p><p>"It’s changed everything for me, honestly," Razat explained. "I got advertising contracts. I got casting directors that would have never seen me before, that want to see me now. And I have access to roles, main roles, that I didn't have before."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These roles and auditions that Razat now has access to, will only continue to keep her in the limelight. And with it, continue growing her net worth.</p><h2 id=how-camille-razat-39-s-net-worth-has-changed-since-being-cast-on-emily-in-paris>How Camille Razat's Net Worth Has Changed Since Being Cast On Emily In Paris</h2><p>Before joining the <a href=#>cast of Emily in Paris</a>, there was not any information for Razat as far as what her net worth was. But with taking on the role of Camille over the past three seasons, it is fair to say that her income has increased significantly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50732288.jpg><p>Lily Collins is likely <a href=#>making the most money on the show and has the highest net worth</a> at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">around $300,000 per episode</a>. As for <a href=#>Ashley Park</a>, she has quite the Broadway resume and has been nominated for her role in the series. As such, it is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated she makes $100,000 per episode</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Park getting more screen time than Razat initially, it would not be unheard of for Razat to initially be making less. But as Razat has been more of a central character and a fan favorite, it is not out of the realm of possibility for her to be making $100,000 as well.</p><p>The money from Emily in Paris, becoming a spokesmodel for Loreal Paris, continuing with a modeling career, and being offered much heartier roles has given Razat a net worth of $1 million.</p><p>But with the recognition that Emily in Paris has brought the actress, it would not be surprising to see this number jump exponentially over the course of the next few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyiqmabkaK2rbjEZqmaspGpeq%2Bx02auqKqknXqmucilsGahnmK9or7IrGY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-much-is-camille-razat-net-worth-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-much-is-camille-razat-net-worth-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-much-is-camille-razat-net-worth-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-much-is-camille-razat-net-worth-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-much-is-camille-razat-net-worth-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-much-is-camille-razat-net-worth-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./daniel-neeson.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./daniel-neeson.html>Daniel Neeson</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ronna-mcdaniel-related-to-mitt-romney-family.html>Ronna McDaniel Related To Mitt Romney | Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ronna-mcdaniel-related-to-mitt-romney-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
