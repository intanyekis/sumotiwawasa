However, she might surpass her sister this year. Kendall grew up in use with fame, since she was just a child when The KUWTK became a popular show. She is more discrete than the rest of her family when it comes to her personal life, but it doesn't mean she doesn't know how to use her image to make money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Million Dollar Smiles: 10 Wealthiest Super Models Of All-Time</a></span></p><p>Kendall Jenner is one of the most prominent models in her generation, and she is the <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest-paid model</a> in the world.
