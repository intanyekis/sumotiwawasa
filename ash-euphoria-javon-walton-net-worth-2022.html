Best known for <a href=#>introducing the world to Sydney Sweeney</a> and its frank depictions of teen addiction, Euphoria also quickly became highly controversial. Given the impact that Euphoria had on pop culture, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that lots of actors would do just about anything to join the show’s cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Sydney Sweeney Is The Most Promising Star Of 'Euphoria'</a></span></p><p>After appearing in the first season of Euphoria, Javon Walton’s role in the show was upgraded to recurring during the show’s second season. Since the second season of Euphoria was filmed, <a href=#>the show’s stars have said a lot about its production</a>. Despite that, Euphoria fans still have a lot of questions about the show. For example, many fans want to know how much starring in Euphoria added to Javon Walton’s net worth.</p><h2 id=who-is-javon-walton>Who Is Javon Walton?</h2><p>Years before Javon Walton made his acting debut, the youngster was already proving that he was destined to lead an extraordinary life. A born athlete, by October of 2017 Walton had already made such a name for himself that he appeared on the Steve Harvey Show. Both a boxing and gymnastics prodigy, Walton entertained Harvey by showing off his swift fists and doing a headstand on Steve’s desk.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the months that followed his appearance on The Steve Harvey Show, Javon Walton wound up starring in the same commercial as an even bigger star, <a href=#>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a>. In the commercial for Under Armour, Walton could be seen in a boxing ring and performing as a gymnast. To say that being in a commercial that put him on a similar level as one of the biggest movie stars in the world was a big deal for Walton is a huge understatement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the future, Javon Walton has dreams of competing in the Olympics as both a gymnast and boxer. Of course, that is a very difficult accomplishment for anyone to achieve but in the meantime, Walton has already pulled off something that millions of people have failed at. After all, Walton has managed to become a successful television and film actor.</p><p>In 2019, Javon Walton made his television debut when he appeared in several episodes of Euphoria’s first season. Cast as Ashtray, a child who was thrust into the world of illegal substance sales, Walton seemed to make the most of every scene from the hit show he appeared in. Still best known for his Euphoria role, Walton’s acting career has branched out in a lot of ways since he landed his debut role.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 'Umbrella Academy' Season 3 Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2020, Javon Walton starred in the show Utopia which was based on a successful British series of the same name. Sadly, Walton’s version of Utopia was canceled after only one season but he quickly moved on to another role. Hired to take over the character of Pugsley Addams in the animated movie The Addams Family 2, Walton lent his voice to the role. Most recently, Walton played a very notable role in Euphoria’s second season and he joined the cast of The Umbrella Academy’s third season. Finally, Walton co-stars with Sylvester Stallone in the upcoming superhero movie Samaritan.</p><p>Based on all of the roles Javon Walton has earned to date, it seems extremely clear that the powers that be in Hollywood are well aware of his potential. With that in mind, it seems all but certain that Walton will attain even more success in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-javon-walton-get-paid-to-star-in-euphoria>How Much Money Did Javon Walton Get Paid To Star In Euphoria?</h2><p>Despite the fact that Javon Walton has already achieved more in life than most people accomplish in a lifetime, the fact remains that he isn’t a household name, at least as of yet. As a result, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that the big financial publications like Forbes and celebritynetworth.com haven’t reported on the youngster’s finances as of the time of this writing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Angus Cloud And Javon Walton Were Heartbroken At The End Of 'Euphoria' Season 2</a></span></p><p>In the future, more will almost certainly be learned about Javon Walton as he goes from being the next big thing to being one of Hollywood’s most famous young stars. Until then, anyone wanting to know about Walton’s Euphoria salary will have to turn to less reliable sources for information. According to factsbuddy.com, Walton’s Euphoria salary was $85,000 for the second season whereas biooverview.com <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed the young actor was paid $200.000</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While neither of the aforementioned websites is overly credible, it is important to put their reports in a greater context. According to the reliable website lifeandstylemag.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sydney Sweeney was paid $350,000 for Euphoria’s second season</a> and there are rumors that Zendaya made $500,000. With those figures in mind, Javon Walton’s salary for Euphoria’s second season ranging from $85,000 to $200,000 seems reasonable. Still, it is important to note that Walton’s estimated salary definitely hasn’t been confirmed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYrKBdmsKxtM6roJplmpbDsLqMsJilrJ%2Bjeq%2Bx02auqKqknXpzfJFrZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fash-euphoria-javon-walton-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fash-euphoria-javon-walton-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fash-euphoria-javon-walton-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fash-euphoria-javon-walton-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fash-euphoria-javon-walton-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fash-euphoria-javon-walton-net-worth-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-b-jordans-creed-2-fitness-routine-cheesesteak-cheat.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-b-jordans-creed-2-fitness-routine-cheesesteak-cheat.html>Michael B.
