Pam is having a blast in the role and although it is a short-term project, Anderson recently revealed that she has long-term aspirations on stage. With that being said, did she quietly retire from film and TV projects? Here's what we know.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-pamela-anderson-quietly-retire-from-hollywood>Did Pamela Anderson Quietly Retire From Hollywood?</h2><p>Pamela Anderson's obvious breakout took place during her time on 'Baywatch'. Despite the success of the show, <a href=#>Anderson revealed that not only did she avoid watching the series</a>, but during, she was never very confident in herself either. She discussed her time on the series alongside Interview Magazine.</p><p>"I never felt really confident in what I was doing in the past. I don’t regret Baywatch. It was a positive experience for me, and it did me a lot of good. I mean, a lot of good! But, c’mon, what was I supposed to do? Go home and have Baywatch parties and have my friends come over and watch me on television?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’ve never seen an episode of Baywatch.

Nonetheless, she did reveal that her true story will come out one day down the road.</p><p>Though in truth, it might not be any time soon as her current priorities seem to be tied up elsewhere, outside of Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pamela-anderson-is-loving-the-broadway-life>Pamela Anderson Is Loving The Broadway Life</h2><p>In a twist nobody could have predicted, Pamela Anderson was all smiles making her Broadway debut as Roxie Hart in the classic, Chicago. <a href=#>Anderson is gushing over the experience</a>, loving every minute of her work on the stage.</p><p>"I'm like a sponge. I'm just soaking it all in," she said. "Every single experience has been just wild. I mean, it's wild to even be here. I have to pinch myself sometimes because it seems so surreal," the star stated alongside People.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Would Pamela Anderson Ever Be Interested In A 'Baywatch' Reboot?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although the role is for a limited time, Anderson might be looking at this as a long-term situation, putting her Hollywood days on the back-burner. According to Anderson, this might be the start of something she does for the rest of her career.</p><p>"This is the beginning of the rest of my career — maybe," Anderson continued.</p><p>"I needed this right now," she said. "I feel like this is something I really needed to sink my teeth into. I love to work. I love to work hard. You know what, I kind of thought, 'Well, I'll just kick back and take it easy.' It's like, 'Oh no, no, no. I still need to work. I'm not that old yet!' "</p><p>"I have nothing to lose. I've got nothing to live up to and I've got nothing to lose. I'm going crazy. I'm going for broke."</p><p>Up until June 5th, Anderson will be appearing at the New York City's Ambassador Theatre. Who knows, if all goes well, maybe it'll be for a lot longer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anderson-s-career-priorities-have-shifted>Anderson's Career Priorities Have Shifted</h2><p>It should be noted that a big reason for Anderson's newest project has to do with a change in mind-set. Anderson revealed she's no longer caring about what the media has to say, especially when it comes to negativity.</p><p>“Look, what I’ve gone through has only made me stronger. Anything you survive does. And I’ve learned a lot of lessons about patience and separating myself from all the garbage. One of them is that you have to believe that everything is a blessing, even if it’s one in disguise. You can get through it if you trust that it’s all for a reason.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anderson is definitely living up to her words, at the age of 54, starting an entirely different project in her life and one nobody could have predicted.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Pamela Anderson's Real Thoughts About Marriage</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdpa6uscuaZJqmlJq%2FtLvNZqmerJmnsm6y0aikZqCfobm6w86om2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-pamela-anderson-retire-from-hollywood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-pamela-anderson-retire-from-hollywood.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-pamela-anderson-retire-from-hollywood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-pamela-anderson-retire-from-hollywood.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-pamela-anderson-retire-from-hollywood.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-pamela-anderson-retire-from-hollywood.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./katt-williams.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./katt-williams.html>Katt Williams</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./elizabeth-moses.html>Tracy Nelson's Daughter, Remington Elizabeth Moses Got Engaged To Her Fiancee, James Camali in 2021</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./elizabeth-moses.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
