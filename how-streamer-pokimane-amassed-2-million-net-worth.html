She's even appearing in Ryan Reynolds' 'Free Guy' film soon, though there's no news yet on whether she'll be in <a href=#>the sequel that's currently in development</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, Pokimane will get a nice paycheck for her role in the movie. But even before her ventures in acting, Pokimane had an impressive net worth.</p><h2 id=who-is-pokimane>Who Is Pokimane?</h2><p>Pokimane is Imane Anys, a self-described content creator, streamer, and gamer who is Canadian Moroccan and began building up her Twitch empire at just 17. In what turned out to be a brilliantly lucrative move, Anys dropped out of college to pursue streaming as a career.</p><p>Her rise to fame is very unconventional, but Pokimane's content creation chops earned her unique attention from Twitch, and she soon became one of their direct partners.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, Pokimane appears in plenty of Twitch spots, supported their Twitch Creator Camp, and has also appeared in music videos and in other projects in recent years. But she's done tons of other stuff too, as evidenced by the variety in her various YouTube channels.</p><p>While Pokimane started out as a gamer, she's also expanded into lifestyle content, so fans are excited to see what she'll pursue next. Whatever it is, it'll no doubt increase her net worth even more; the influencer has made some pretty smart financial decisions already.</p><h2 id=what-is-pokimane-39-s-net-worth>What Is Pokimane's Net Worth?</h2><p>Multiple sources agree that Imane "Pokimane" Anys has a net worth of $2 million, but it may be closer to $3M these days. Since she's been active in the gaming scene since 2013, her average yearly income doesn't seem insanely high.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Twitch Streamers Who Make Way More Money Than You</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Imane's popularity didn't really skyrocket until 2017, when she became one of the most followed gamers on Twitch. So it's safe to assume that she began making more per year after that jump in subscribers.</p><p>Now, Pokimane has nearly 8 million combined subscribers, and she's even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signed an exclusivity deal</a> with Twitch to stick around long-term, per Forbes. That's not her only source of income, though.</p><p>Pokimane has also cofounded a creators collective (OfflineTV) and is a creative director of a gaming clothes brand (Cloak) with fellow gamers Jacksepticeye and Markiplier. Much like fellow <a href=#>YouTuber Jeffree Star, whose income streams extend far beyond his video earnings</a>, Anys has built up some other ways to earn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dabbling in all these other endeavors has nicely boosted her bottom line, and that means Pokimane's monthly income has likely seen a jump recently.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-pokimane-make-per-month>How Much Does Pokimane Make Per Month?</h2><p>She's got an impressive net worth, but what fans really want to know is how much cash Pokimane pulls in each month. So how much does Pokimane make in a year, and what monthly salary does that equate to?</p><p>Sources seem to disagree on the specific figures, so estimates of Imane's income vary between $300K and $600K per year. That means streamer Pokimane may be raking in anywhere from $30K to $50K per month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But where does that cash come from? Various income streams, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources confirm</a>. As noted, Pokimane is the face of a few different brands these days. But she also has steady cash flow stemming from her YouTube channel (an estimated $5K to $10K per month), and an estimated $25K from Twitch alone.</p><p>These are all just assumptions, of course, because Pokimane doesn't really talk about the cash she has coming in... Except in the case of that $80M subscriber "donation."</p><h2 id=did-someone-actually-give-pokimane-80-million>Did Someone Actually Give Pokimane $80 Million?</h2><p>With Pokimane's impressive level of popularity, she clearly rakes in the money based on her subscriber count alone. But did a follower (or "simp") really gift her $80 million? Probably not.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Total Divas Star Isn’t Pleased With WWE’s Twitch Ban</a></span></p><p>The same way that a lot of YouTubers create farcical videos to promote their channels, so fans assume Pokimane did for that $80M 'donation.' A video clip that shows Pokimane's reaction to the 'donation' is essentially a meme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It features footage of Walter White from 'Breaking Bad' spliced into Pokimane's 'reaction,' and it's very clearly a fake (yet pretty funny) meme.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-richest-game-streamer>Who Is The Richest Game Streamer?</h2><p>If Pokimane didn't really receive $80M, and her net worth is around $2M, where does she fall in terms of the richest gaming streamer rankings? According to the list of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">richest gamers</a> (on Twitch), Pokimane doesn't even rank in the top ten.</p><p>That could be because her income includes more than just streaming, though the list-generating team apparently accounted for that in their estimations. According to those figures, Nickmercs is the highest earner of all current Twitch streamers, earning approximately $1.5M per year.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's How Tana Mongeau Became A Rich YouTuber</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqMGzscCmnKtloKS4qrnAp5xmmZ2WwLSxw2ZpZqWZobmqu81mpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-streamer-pokimane-amassed-2-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./owner-of-nibs-and-emory-hotel-dies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./owner-of-nibs-and-emory-hotel-dies.html>Owner Of NIBS And Emory Hotel Dies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-jimmie-allen-the-country-singer-who-is-being-sued-for-sexual-assault.html>Who is Jimmie Allen?
