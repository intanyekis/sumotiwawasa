That's because Howard has a propensity for asking questions about a star's love life. Sure, Taylor has always been open about the trials and tribulations of her romantic history... albeit through the lyrics of her songs. But Howard asks the kind of questions that really deserve straight-up and sometimes uncomfortably honest answers. Taylor's lyrics open the door for the fans to speculate what and who is involved. But Howard would want straight facts and probably wouldn't put up with evasive maneuvers to get out of answering a question such as 'What did Jake Gyllenhaal really do that was so bad that it inspired you to write "All Too Well"?'</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In all likelihood, Taylor will never go on the Sirius satellite radio program. While she has been spotted sitting near Howard at Knicks games in New York, as well as just meters away from Howard at the SiriusXM studios, it seems as though she's keeping her distance from the former shock jock. But this probably doesn't bother Howard too much as he doesn't seem to be too thrilled with her music. More importantly, he has basically advised people to stay away from T-Swift altogether. Here's why...</p><h2 id=howard-stern-thinks-men-would-be-smart-not-to-date-taylor-swift>Howard Stern Thinks Men Would Be Smart Not To Date Taylor Swift</h2><p>Howard Stern is certainly not the first person to suggest that men shouldn't go out of their way to date the insanely successful and beautiful music superstar. After all, Taylor has a propensity of sharing her perspective of her time with each of her ex-boyfriends in the lyrics of her songs... even if it's not always clear which lyrics slams which star. But the topic came up recently on The Howard Stern Show after Howard had seen Taylor's 10 minute "All Too Well" performance on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was looking at that song that Taylor Swift [did], boy, I'd be afraid to go out with her," Howard Stern said to his co-host Robin Quivers and his audience <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on November 15th, 2021</a>.</p><p>"That was the best, that Colin Jost joke after [Taylor's Saturday Night Live] performance. Like we all just figured out we never want to date Taylor Swift," Robin laughed. "She doesn't like it when people leave her."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About All Of Howard Stern's Health Issues</a></span></p><p>Howard went on to say that he was reading about <a href=#>Taylor's past relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal</a> who is said to be the inspiration of the song. Jake has been a guest on The Howard Stern Show twice and both Howard and Robin thought he was a "terrific" guy. Robin even claimed to have a massive crush on him. While they never dated him like Taylor did, they just couldn't understand why he'd be the type to be a bad boyfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From what he read, Howard believes Jake just told Taylor that things were not working out between them and used age as an excuse. Of course, this was one of the things that Taylor took Umbridge with and pointed out that Jake's follow-up girlfriend was even younger than Taylor.</p><p>"[Jake said] whatever bulls*** [excuse] to make her feel okay as he didn't want a song written about him. The guy's a serious actor," Howard said.</p><p>"He's trying to get out and leave her with some dignity so that she doesn't feel bad," Robin agreed. "No matter what a person says, they're not into you, that's why they are leaving. He left her because he left her. He was done."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Howard Stern's Co-Host Robin Quivers Deeply Regrets Writing Her Book</a></span></p><p>At the end of the day, Taylor was hung up on the excuse that she apparently received from Jake. While every singer has written about their love life, there seems to be something different about the way that Taylor does it. Part of that has to do with the response the fans have to it. And, quite often, they create a toxic environment where they gang up on the man Taylor points out without even hearing his side of the story nor Taylor giving her fans the full context of her experience. Instead, she writes around it. The result are hit songs that millions of people love. But as Howard and Robin said, it should be a warning sign to anyone who wants to date her in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-has-defended-taylor-swift-for-her-politics>Howard Has Defended Taylor Swift For Her Politics</h2><p>Based on his opinion of "All Too Well", it may seem as though Howard loathes Taylor Swift. But that's not true. In fact, he has openly praised her in previous segments on his show. Specifically, he loved when she decided to come clean about her politics in order to help President Joe Biden win the 2020 election.</p><p>"Celebrities who won’t say who they’re voting for because they don’t want to piss off their public — f*** you too!", Howard said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">back in early November 2020</a>. "Like Taylor Swift, good for her. She has like 83 million followers and she came out and said who she’s voting for and I’m like good, that’s standing up for your country."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear that Howard is always going to be honest about his opinions, even if that sometimes criticizes a celebrity he's previously praised. This type of honesty is precisely what Howard would expect from Taylor Swift should she ever decide to be interviewed on his acclaimed radio show.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Why Fans Are Totally Wrong To Drag Kate Beckinsale For Her IQ Comments To Howard Stern</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9Oeqadlo6muunnAsJiyZaSWxq270WaqsKGWqXqltdKloKSdXaeyra3Toqanq5ievbR5xLFkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dqmarn6O0tHnJmqKeZZeuua2xzaGYmqRf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhoward-stern-stay-away-taylor-swift-dislike-relationships-ex-boyfriends-songs-jake-gyllenhaal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhoward-stern-stay-away-taylor-swift-dislike-relationships-ex-boyfriends-songs-jake-gyllenhaal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhoward-stern-stay-away-taylor-swift-dislike-relationships-ex-boyfriends-songs-jake-gyllenhaal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhoward-stern-stay-away-taylor-swift-dislike-relationships-ex-boyfriends-songs-jake-gyllenhaal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhoward-stern-stay-away-taylor-swift-dislike-relationships-ex-boyfriends-songs-jake-gyllenhaal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhoward-stern-stay-away-taylor-swift-dislike-relationships-ex-boyfriends-songs-jake-gyllenhaal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bobbi-althoff-daughter-real-name-sparks-debate-defends-choice.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bobbi-althoff-daughter-real-name-sparks-debate-defends-choice.html>Bobbi Althoff Daughter Real Name Sparks Debate &amp;amp; Defends Choice</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./laurel-waghorn-wiki.html>Who is Laurel Waghorn?
