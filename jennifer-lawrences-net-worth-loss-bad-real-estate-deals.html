Thanks to the fact that Jennifer Lawrence has made a fortune due to her career as a movie star, she was able to buy an apartment in a building from that area called The Laurel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jan-mad-at-michael-1.jpg><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how The Laurel is described on cityrealty.com</a>, it sounds like the building is pretty incredible to live in. It also is worth noting that the building has someone watching the door at all times which is something a star who values their privacy would want.</p><p>"The Laurel is a 31-story condominium tower at 400 East 67th Street on the Upper East Side. Designed to be energy efficient and environmentally sustainable, it is LEED-certified. It features residences that have solid oak wood flooring, large windows, ceilings between 9 and 12 feet and Bosch washers and dryers. Units range from studios to four bedrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jennifer-lawrence-s-disastrous-real-estate-deals-lost-her-more-than-5-million-in-less-than-five-years.jpg><p>The description continues, "The pet-friendly Laurel’s amenities include the Trophy Club, a bi-level fitness and triathlon training center, and the Laurel Club, a two-story space equipped with a screening room, a dining room, a catering kitchen and a game room. Concierge service, a full-time doorman and parking are also offered.

The interior includes a chef's kitchen (with a wine fridge), floor-to-ceiling windows and access to a private terrace that offers sweeping views of the city. "</p><p>People continues, "Bedrooms are separated from the front rooms by a long hallway. The cozy main suite comes with a soaking tub, a spacious dressing room and a marble double sink. Split-level outdoor terraces wrap the apartment and offer plenty of space to entertain Lawrence's famous pals. There's also an outdoor kitchen, fireplace, pergola and a built-in ping pong table."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jennifer-Lawrence-Featured-Image.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Lawrence's apartment sounds so impressive, it likely won't surprise anyone that she paid millions for it. Still, a lot of people wouldn't expect that in 2016 the famous actor paid $15.6 million for her apartment in The Laurel.</p><p>In July 2019, Lawrence decided that she wanted to sell her apartment, so she put it on the market for the first time. Even at that point, Lawrence was prepared to take a small loss as she was asking for $15.45 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence Revealed That She Never Understood One Of Her Biggest Box Office Flops, Despite Dating The Director</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Lawrence, the real estate market can raise and fall in short order and by then it was clear nobody would pay that price. By January 2020, Lawrence had clearly come to terms with that as she lowered her price for the apartment to $12 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that point, Lawrence was offering her apartment at a loss of more than 3.5 million, so she must have thought it wouldn't take long to sell. Amazingly enough, however, Lawrence would wind up taking a much larger loss than that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jennifer-lawrence-waving-goodbye.jpg><p>By August 2020, Lawrence had finally sold her apartment for an amount that wasn't immediately clear. It wouldn't take long for the media to learn that the final price tag was $9.9 million which meant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lawrence ultimately took a $5.7 million loss</a> on the sale.</p><p>Of course, most people have never had that kind of money let alone be able to survive taking that kind of loss.

In reality, however, loads of people lose money on real estate. Lawrence just lost a much larger amount of money because she is rich enough to buy expensive real estate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sean Evans Had A Look Of Concern During Hot Ones, And He Was Completely Right Given That His Guest Went To The Hospital After The Show</a></span></p><p>Keeping in mind that losing money on real estate isn't that remarkable, that makes people wonder what other stars have made similarly bad deals. Sadly for the stars involved, many celebrities have lost a fortune on real estate.</p><p>In recent years, Britney Spears bought and sold a Los Angeles mansion. Between the two deals, <a href=#>Spears lost almost $2 million in a matter of months</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, there have been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many celebrities who lost more than a million on a real estate deal</a>. Some examples of those stars include Michelle Pfeiffer, David E. Kelley, Sandra Bullock, LeBron James, Simon Cowell, Justin Bieber, and Channing Tatum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/kim-basinger-now.jpg><p>However, there is one real estate deal that a celebrity was involved in that is a notorious example of a massive mistake. Tragically for Kim Basinger, she is the movie star who made a deal that was so bad that it inspired a hit sitcom that premiered almost three decades later.</p><p>In 1989, Basinger bought the majority of a town that was known as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Braselton, Georgia for $20 million</a>. Keep in mind, that is $20 million in 1989 money. At the time, Basinger wanted to turn the town into a tourist attraction with major recording and movie production studios.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, none of those plans came to fruition and after Basinger declared bankruptcy, the land was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold for just $1 million</a> according to CNBC. The whole series of events became so infamous that <a href=#>it partially inspired the show Schitt's Creek</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoylmLCqlaOwpr%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jKWmrKtdl66ledGemKVllajBosDEZpuemZyofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjennifer-lawrences-net-worth-loss-bad-real-estate-deals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjennifer-lawrences-net-worth-loss-bad-real-estate-deals.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjennifer-lawrences-net-worth-loss-bad-real-estate-deals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjennifer-lawrences-net-worth-loss-bad-real-estate-deals.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjennifer-lawrences-net-worth-loss-bad-real-estate-deals.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjennifer-lawrences-net-worth-loss-bad-real-estate-deals.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rebel-wilson-broke-up-with-jacob-busch-over-text-message.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rebel-wilson-broke-up-with-jacob-busch-over-text-message.html>Rebel Wilson Broke Up With Jacob Busch Over Text Message</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fans-believes-robbie-coltrane-is-sick-what-happened-to-harry-potter-star.html>Fans Believes Robbie Coltrane Is Sick - What Happened To Harry Potter Star?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fans-believes-robbie-coltrane-is-sick-what-happened-to-harry-potter-star.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
