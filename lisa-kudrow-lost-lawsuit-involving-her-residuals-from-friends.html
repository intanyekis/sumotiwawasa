The court case was dealing with a sexual harassment lawsuit that apparently took place behind the scenes.</p><p>The LA Times writes, "The California Supreme Court threw out a sexual harassment lawsuit against the makers of the hit comedy “Friends” on Thursday, ruling that vulgar and coarse comments by the show’s writers reflected the “creative workplace” for a comedy with sexual themes."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/friends-cast-at-the-friends-reunion.jpg><p>"In ruling unanimously for Warner Bros.

Camille Cerio is suing the actor for breach of contract and claims he owes her commission for managing his career."</p><p>"LeBlanc maintains he has paid Cerio more than $200,000 (GBP100,000) in payments, but in a lawsuit filed at Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this month (2Jul08), Cerio claims the amount is nothing compared to his royalties from Friends and spin-off Joey. Cerio claims that LeBlanc agreed to cut her 15 percent from all the pilots, but stopped paying her in 2000."</p><p>Unlike Lisa Kudrow was forced to pay her former manager, it doesn't seem like LeBlanc was found guilty of the claims. There wasn't any type of resolution posted online to the court case - which means the case was either dropped completely, or that a settlement was reached outside of court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is clear, former managers wanted a chunk of the success from Friends, especially given the massive contracts negotiated by the cast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYri2sNGormakn6jBbrjAsKquoaRitq%2FCzqWtoqaXYrWmvoyrnKyhlKqurb%2BMn6mopV2bv6qxzZ2qaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flisa-kudrow-lost-lawsuit-involving-her-residuals-from-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flisa-kudrow-lost-lawsuit-involving-her-residuals-from-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flisa-kudrow-lost-lawsuit-involving-her-residuals-from-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flisa-kudrow-lost-lawsuit-involving-her-residuals-from-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flisa-kudrow-lost-lawsuit-involving-her-residuals-from-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flisa-kudrow-lost-lawsuit-involving-her-residuals-from-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lorne-michaels-created-rules-around-what-could-be-said-about-donald-trump-on-snl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lorne-michaels-created-rules-around-what-could-be-said-about-donald-trump-on-snl.html>Lorne Michaels Created Rules Around What Could Be Said About Donald Trump, And It Didn't Sit Well Wi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jason-biggs-my-son-almost-found-out-about-american-pie-scene.html>Jason Biggs: My Son Almost Found Out About 'American Pie' Scene</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jason-biggs-my-son-almost-found-out-about-american-pie-scene.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
