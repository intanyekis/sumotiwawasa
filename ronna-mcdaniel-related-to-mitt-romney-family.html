She held that position until 2015.</p><p>Her tenure as the Michigan Republican Party chairperson from 2015 to 2017 played a pivotal role in securing the state for Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>On the other hand, Mitt Romney, who was born in 1947, began his professional life in business consulting, holding positions at Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company following his Harvard MBA.</p><p>Later, from 2003 to 2007, he held the office of 70th Governor of Massachusetts, and in 2012, he was nominated by the Republicans for president.</p><p>Romney and McDaniel have both been significant Republican leaders, but their paths have not coincided.</p><p>While McDaniel was successful in Michigan state politics, Romney used his business experience to gain national prominence as a governor.</p><p>An intriguing connection between their disparate political careers is their Michigan connection.</p><h2><span id=Is_Mitt_Romney_Related_To_Ronna_McDaniel>Is Mitt Romney Related To Ronna McDaniel?</span></h2><p>Ronna McDaniel is Mitt Romney’s niece, so the answer is yes.</p><p>McDaniel is Mitt Romney’s older brother Scott Romney’s daughter.</p><p>Because he conflicted with her uncle Mitt, McDaniel omitted the “Romney” from her middle name when President Trump selected her to lead the RNC.</p><p>Mitt Romney has been vocally critical of the previous president, and the two have publicly fought over Trump.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite their disagreements, McDaniel and Romney have both made significant contributions to the Republican Party.</p><p>McDaniel has advocated for Republican gains across the nation in his capacity as RNC chair.</p><p>Additionally, as governor of Massachusetts and the GOP’s 2012 presidential contender, Romney rose to prominence.</p><p>Although they are connected by their Romney ancestry, their differing political ideologies have hampered their friendship.</p><p>Nevertheless, both still influence the Republican Party of today.</p><h2><span id=Details_About_Ronna_McDaniel8217s_And_Mitt_Romney8217s_Family>Details About Ronna McDaniel’s And Mitt Romney’s Family</span></h2><p>Mitt Romney and Ronna McDaniel have close family ties and a history in Republican politics.</p><p>Mitt Romney has three elder siblings, one of them is Scott Romney, the father of Ronna McDaniel.</p><p>In 1973, Ronna McDaniel was born into a homemaker/activist couple, Scott Romney and Ronna Stern Romney.</p><p>Scott, her father, became a successful lawyer and politician in Michigan.</p><p>For many decades, the Romney family has influenced politics, business, and the Mormon Church.</p><p>Mitt used this experience to his advantage as a businessman, Massachusetts governor, and potential presidential candidate.</p><p>Beginning her career in Michigan politics, Ronna McDaniel went on to become chair of the RNC.</p><p>Even though Mitt and his niece Ronna disagree with Donald Trump, they both uphold the Romney legacy of influencing the Republican Party.</p><p>Even if Mitt’s opposition to Trump has recently hampered his connection with Ronna, they are connected by their shared ancestry.</p><p>The Romney family as a whole stands for a durable political dynasty for Republicans.</p><h2><span id=Mitt_Romney_and_Ronna_McDaniel_Salary>Mitt Romney and Ronna McDaniel Salary</span></h2><p>Both Mitt Romney and Ronna McDaniel are extremely wealthy, although in different ways.</p><p>McDaniel, who chairs the Republican National Committee, is thought to be valued between $2 and $20 million.</p><p>Her prior employment in marketing and advertising, along with her political career, helped her accumulate a fortune. In 2020, her income at the RNC exceeded $400,000.</p><p>On the other hand, Mitt Romney’s estimated net worth is $300 million, which he has amassed throughout his incredibly prosperous business career and political pursuits.</p><p>His fortune increased dramatically over time when he co-founded one of the biggest private equity firms in the country, Bain Capital.</p><p>Romney also benefited from his positions as senator and governor of Massachusetts in addition to being a best-selling writer.</p><p>Even though they have both accumulated substantial personal wealth, Mitt Romney’s net worth is greater than Ronna McDaniel’s because of his extremely successful private sector career before entering politics.</p><p>Their disparate career paths are reflected in their riches.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Smolsprout, Martin Braithwaite, and Victoria Mercado."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":63}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/smolsprout/"}{"1":21}{"1":23,"2":"https://popularbio.com/martin-braithwaite/"}{"1":41}{"1":47,"2":"https://popularbio.com/victoria-mercado/"}{"1":63}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Smolsprout</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Martin Braithwaite</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Victoria Mercado</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Politician</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Antonio Banderas | Wife Ana Leza</a></h3>Spanish actress Ana Leza has a few film and television credits to her name.
