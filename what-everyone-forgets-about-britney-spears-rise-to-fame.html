I Did It Again. "Lucky" tells the story of a young girl who is suddenly propelled into a level of fame which would be difficult for people twice her age to handle. Even though "Lucky" is a song about a fictional character, its subject matter could easily pertain to Britney herself!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Brit-Brit" rose to fame at an extremely young age, and this young girl from Kentwood, Louisana, set a precedent for young entertainers for decades to come. Britney released her debut album at 16-years-old, years after she appeared on the New Mickey Mouse Club, and soon became a worldwide sensation. Let's look back at Britney's early career!</p><h2 id=britney-always-loved-whitney><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Britney Always Loved Whitney</span></h2><p>There are few songstresses in the world who have out-of-this-world vocal ranges. These types of singers have extremely unique gifts and make such an impression on aspiring singers. Whitney Houston was one of those singers.</p><p>Young Britney Spears was no exception - she was a Whitney Houston devotee! Britney incorporated Whitney into her history early on; she sang a cover version of Whitney's beloved hit, "I Will Always Love You",&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which got Britney a record deal</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brit-did-early-performances-at-shopping-malls><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Brit Did Early Performances At Shopping Malls</span></h2><p>Brit's introduction into pop culture began in a rather quiet way; one of young Britney's first performances in front of an audience happened in a setting that's considered a central hub for girls just like her!</p><p>Britney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had the opportunity to come face-to-face with fans</a>&nbsp;close to her own age when she did some gigs at shopping malls.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Pics Of Britney Spears That Were Way Too Hot For The â€˜90s</a></span></p><h2 id=mature-themes-weren-t-really-britney-s-dream><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Mature Themes Weren't Really Britney's Dream</span></h2><p>Britney may have been just starting out, but she already had enough self-confidence to know exactly what kind of performer she wanted to be!</p><p>Britney knew exactly what she was comfortable with as a performer, and exactly what her limits were!

There's a strong chance Britney has done the same, IRL! Her love for legendary divas doesn't stop with Whitney.

As it turns out, Brit was hooked on the tune, too. This&nbsp;debut tune <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was special to Britney Spears as a singer</a>, because the subject matter was relatable to her as a young teen!</p><h2 id=she-was-almost-a-singer-songwriter><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Was Almost A Singer-Songwriter</span></h2><p>If it makes her happy, it can't be that bad, right?</p><p>Britney has always been proud of her Southern hometown. She is always singing the praises of the Louisana town and has been since day one! Britney's Southern influence almost made its way into her music - in fact,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the direction of her career could have been very different</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-hottest-song-could-ve-been-very-different><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Her Hottest Song Could've Been Very Different</span></h2><p>They were famous for being vocal about their distaste for "scrubs". As it turns out, the ladies of TLC weren't very keen on the song that broke Britney into the mainstream, either.</p><p>That's right - Britney's first single was rejected by TLC! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When the group was presented with "...Baby One More Time</a>," T-Boz didn't feel that song fit TLC's vibe!</p><h2 id=britney-knew-what-people-were-talking-about><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Britney Knew What People Were Talking About</span></h2><p>Despite Britney's young age, our girl was very in tune with the biz!</p><p>Several pop star gals are familiar with how to tailor their images just how they like them. Brit was an old pro early on in her career. When she appeared on the cover on Rolling Stone magazine back in 1999. Britney's controversial cover <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stirred up lots of conversation</a>, but she welcomed it!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Ups And Downs In Britney Spears' Career, In 20 Pictures</a></span></p><h2 id=britney-wanted-to-make-some-changes-one-more-time><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Britney Wanted To Make Some Changes One More Time</span></h2><p>Remember the first time you ever saw Britney onscreen? Chances are, you couldn't help but notice her memorable school girl outfit, which she wore in her debut music video. However, Brit was originally supposed to rock a very different type of outfit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In the early drafts of the video's concept</a>, "...Baby One More Time" was set in outer space!</p><h2 id=brit-hung-out-with-teenage-witches><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brit Hung Out With Teenage Witches</span></h2><p>Brit-Brit had memorable faces in her early crew and one gal Britney ran around with back then is familiar to many!</p><p>Melissa Joan Hart is an actress responsible for multiple classic roles, memorable to multiple generations. Not only was she Sabrina, The Teenage Witch, she was also an extra in Brit's music video for, "Drive Me Crazy". That song was on the soundtrack of Melissa's movie of the same name.</p><h2 id=britney-was-connected-to-email><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Britney Was Connected To Email</span></h2><p>Britney's star power is timeless, but one factor that will always keep her in the 1990s? The track "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E-Mail My Heart</a>" on her debut album, ...Baby One More Time.</p><p>Internet gifs and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clips of early interviews with Brit</a> have made the song legendary, but initially, it was lost among the album's less memorable tracks.</p><p>Talk about a landmark ballad about communication!

With her sophomore album,&nbsp;Oops!...I Did It Again, she evolved as an artist. It was released in the spring of 2000. While Britney may have wanted to keep up a certain beat during her early years, she soon wanted to usher in classic artists for a new generation! Britney paid homage to a classic diva who came before her, by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">covering a Cher song.</a></p><h2 id=britney-was-a-commercial-cutie><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Britney Was A Commercial Cutie</span></h2><p>Britney's journey as a pop diva wasn't limited to a classic library of banger songs and singles!
