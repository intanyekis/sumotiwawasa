They got back together soon after separating but officially called it quits in 2009. It seems that Shaq's height didn't bother his ex-wife at all. In an interview with Access Hollywood, when discussing his & hers bathrooms, Shaunie lightheartedly asked Shaquille O'Neal "Why do you need a bigger bathroom?" Shaquille answered "cause I got a bigger a** than you" instantly making Shaunie laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Were All The Women In Shaquille O'Neal's Life?</a></span></p><p>Shaunie O'Neal once said, "Everyone's always surprised that I'm not short.

"Really?" Kimmel questioned, which led to Nicole getting on stage and showing the audience just that. The reality star gave her NBA ex-boyfriend a piggyback ride - and in high heels! She impressively made it to ten steps before collapsing and falling onto the floor with O'Neal following in tow. The audience cheers were wild for Nicole, and Jimmy commended the flavor of love star, saying "Wow, that's impressive, she is strong".</p><p>Despite being a charismatic couple, the pair ended their relationship in 2012 after mediatakeout.com reported that the couple got into a heated argument in front of several children at a gymnastics training center in Florida.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shaquille O'Neal has been linked to various other women including <a href=#>author Karrine Steffans, reality star Laura Govan</a> and model Laticia Rolle who he dated from 2014 to 2018.
