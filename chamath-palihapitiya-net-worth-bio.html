Get past the product market fit, figure out whether people actually care about what you’re trying to build and someone will pay you money for that. That’s the zero to one problem. So scaling, one through N, is figuring out can you do that at scale and how big is the scale.”&nbsp;<strong>– Chamath Palihapitiya</strong></p><p>“As you start the company, you start spending spending spending ahead of revenue but then you come out of it and very quickly you should become a company that spends less than it makes. And what I mean by very quickly, is that window of time should be in that 6 to 8 year time frame. And the reason is because if you build your business model correctly it’s almost unavoidable.”&nbsp;<strong>– Chamath Palihapitiya</strong></p><p>“I think the reality is that it’s never been a better time to be an entrepreneur, it’s never been a better time to work at a startup. You work at a really intellectually free environment, you get to work with people who are like-minded, it’s very energetic. It’s wonderful.”&nbsp;<strong>– Chamath Palihapitiya</strong></p><p>What you should be in a rush for isn’t necessarily the immediate monetary return, but it’s to know that this equation existing between an employee and a company is being honored. What’s the equation? I’m going to give you my most precious thing that I have – my time and my reputation.”&nbsp;<strong>– Chamath Palihapitiya</strong></p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2><h3><strong>How much is Chamath Palihapitiya worth?</strong></h3><p>Chamath Palihapitiya’s net worth is estimated to be $1 Billion.</p><h3><strong>How old is Chamath Palihapitiya?</strong></h3><p>He was born on September 3, 1976, and is currently 46 years old.</p><h3><strong>How tall is Chamath Palihapitiya?</strong></h3><p>His height is 1.85 m, which is equal to 6 ft 1 in.</p><h2><span id=summary class=ez-toc-section></span><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Chamath Palihapitiya is the CEO and founder of Social Capital.
