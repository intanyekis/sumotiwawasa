A group of other celebs will only attempt bravery for one film and use stunt performers for specific films or scenes. There are a number of reasons why celebs use doubles; of course, the number one reason is that most do not want to injure themselves and risk their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A number of celebrities also have insurance covers, which means that if they injure themselves on purpose or by putting themselves in harm’s way, they do not get a dime of their policy money. Thirdly, stunt doubles have professional experience and stamina to perform dangerous acts. However, as important as they are, they are also costly and they add to a film’s budget.</p><p>The list of actors we're going to look at don't mind putting their stunt doubles out of work in order to experience a little rush of adrenaline.</p><h2 id=jason-statham-did-almost-all-of-his-stunts-in-the-transporter><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Jason Statham Did Almost All Of His Stunts In The Transporter</span></h2><p>English actor and producer, Jason Statham, actually did most of his stunts in The Transporter, which included a lot of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">car chases, dives, and fights</a>.
