And fans were happy to learn that Teresa had fallen in love again. At first, Teresa didn't seem to want to talk about Luis Ruelas on the show, and her sister-in-law Melissa Gorga clearly was aware that something was going on. Eventually, Teresa shared the great news, and her co-stars and viewers alike cheered her on as she entered this new phase of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But while it's wonderful that Teresa has a new partner after her divorce from Joe, and <a href=#>fans knew Teresa would get engaged</a>, there has been some talk of Luis having a controverisal past. Is this something that Teresa cares about... or if she so in love that she doesn't mind? Let's take a look at whether Teresa Giudice has forgiven her fiance Luis Ruelas's controversial past.</p><h2 id=teresa-39-s-reaction-to-the-scandal>Teresa's Reaction To The Scandal</h2><p>When someone as famous as Teresa begins dating someone new, people are definitely going to have opinions and questions, and it's going to be a big topic of conversation. <a href=#>Fans have said Joe and Luis look similar</a>, but people have also wondered about the negative press about Luis.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Cohen asked Teresa questions</a> about Luis at The Real Housewives of New Jersey season 11 reunion. Based on what Teresa said, it sounds like she doesn't believe that the talk about Luis is true, and she thinks that people are talking because she's a famous reality star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Too Fab, Andy brought up how Kim DePaola, who used to appear on RHONJ, appeared on the podcast called Behind the Velvet Rope with David Yontef and talked about Luis ruining an ex's tires and even accused him of emotional abuse. Teresa said, "Next question. I don't talk about sewer rats, sorry" and added, "I feel bad for him that this is being done because of me. These girls are so thirsty."</p><p>Andy also mentioned the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six article about Luis</a> which said that he is "sex obsessed." Teresa's response? She said, "Obviously, you can't believe everything you read, but yeah, I have found my match."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andy wanted to know if Teresa was afraid, and she replied, "Not at all. I told him to just ignore it.'</p><p>A source told Page Six that Luis and Joe had met each other and Teresa also met the woman who Luis used to married to, and they are happy together and feeling positive. The source said that "a scorned ex" wanted to get some fame and attention and that's why people have said these things about Luis.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Where ‘RHONJ’ Fans Really Stand On The Teresa And Jackie Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=what-do-people-say-about-luis>What Do People Say About Luis?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Teresa seems to have suggested that what people say about Luis isn't true, it doesn't sound great, as his former partners have spoken out against him. When you're in a new relationship or have just gotten engaged, these aren't things that you want to hear about your partner.</p><p>According to Page Six, Luis was once engaged to Paula Sanchez, and a source said that they argued over Luis's desire to have sex multiple times a day. The source explained, “Ninety-nine percent of their fights were because he was complaining that they weren’t having enough sex. If they had sex like four times in one day, there was a complaint.”</p><p>Vanessa Reiser, another ex-fiance, took legal action against him in 2020. Page Six reported that she shared her story in the court documents: “He demanded that I be available for sex whenever he wanted. If I objected to his demands, Luis Ruelas would punish me. He would be nasty, withdraw from me, and blame me for what happened.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Phrases Invented By Teresa Giudice On 'Real Housewives Of New Jersey'</a></span></p><p>While Teresa has said that people just want to gossip and she sounds very happy and in love, it sounds like Luis's past might become a storyline in season 12 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey. This doesn't seem like something that is going to go away very quickly.</p><p>According to The Sun, a source said that Jennifer Aydin thinks the relationship is a good idea, but Teresa's other co-stars have been negative about it. And Margaret Joseph has been outspoken as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source said, "Everyone has been gossiping about Teresa, however Margaret Josephs has been the most vocal on camera, claiming that Luis Ruelas is a 'sex addict' with 'a history of abuse' in which she references tales that Louie's past girlfriends have shared online." The source talked about Teresa's co-stars saying that Luis is "an opportunist" and said that Teresa's co-stars wonder how she could be with someone with this type of past.</p><p>Page Six reported that Luis was charged with assault against Jesse Palmieri, a man who he got into a "road rage" situation with.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Teresa Giudice Fixed Her Image Post Jail</a></span></p><p>When RHONJ returns for season 12, hopefully there will be more talk about Luis and his past, and fans will be able to learn more about the situation.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Drama In New Jersey: Are Teresa Giudice And Margaret Josephs Still Friends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirnqqVqK5us8ium6KblWKvsMXFq6CeppRis6qtzZycZqiclsaju9hmqpyZnpmurXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteresa-giudice-boyfriend-fiance-playboy-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fteresa-giudice-boyfriend-fiance-playboy-scandal.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fteresa-giudice-boyfriend-fiance-playboy-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fteresa-giudice-boyfriend-fiance-playboy-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteresa-giudice-boyfriend-fiance-playboy-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteresa-giudice-boyfriend-fiance-playboy-scandal.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jay-feely-net-worth-bio-early-life-education-career-endorsements-awards-relationship-status-scandal-body-measurements-social-media.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jay-feely-net-worth-bio-early-life-education-career-endorsements-awards-relationship-status-scandal-body-measurements-social-media.html>Jay Feely Net Worth, Bio, Early life, Education, Career, Endorsements, Awards, Relationship Status,</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./erika-jayne.html>Erika Jayne Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./erika-jayne.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
