<time>02 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Ever since “reality” shows first became an absolute sensation, there have always been a slew of them on the air at any given time. While some people may prefer competition reality shows like Survivor or Big Brother, there are others who enjoy series that revolve around romance and drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For people who prefer reality shows that revolve around relationship drama, the Love & Hip Hop franchise is a perfect option, even though <a href=# rel=nofollow>some aspects of it don’t make any sense</a>. On top of focusing on a lot of juicy gossip, the Love & Hip Hop franchise <a href=# rel=nofollow>has also featured some fascinating stars</a>.</p><p><strong>Updated on March 10, 2023: </strong>It has been seven years since Apryl Jones' split with Omarion and three since her split from Lil Fizz, and the actress had no trouble moving on. In the same year she and Lil Fizz broke up, she got together with Dr. Dre, lasting through 2022. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jones is now dating Broadway star Taye Diggs</a>.</p><p>Omarion, on the other hand, is loving dad life but appears to remain single for the time being. The singer is focusing on his children and his career. Lil Fizz, who is also a father, has not publicly dated anyone since his split with Apryl in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Cast Of Big Brother 24's Net Worth Changed Drastically After The Show</a></span></p><p>Over the last several years, the reality show Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood has featured two members of the boy band B2K. For anyone who enjoyed that group, it will likely be fascinating to get a window into the personal lives of former members Omarion and Lil’ Fizz.</p><p>Even though Omarion and Lil’ Fizz clearly had a bond from touring together for a long time, in recent years their relationship has been very dramatic. The reason for that is because the former bandmates got involved in a much-talked-about love triangle with a woman named Apryl Jones.</p><h2 id=the-origin-of-omarion-apryl-jones-amp-lil-rsquo-fizz-rsquo-s-love-triangle>The Origin Of Omarion, Apryl Jones, & Lil’ Fizz’s Love Triangle</h2><p>During the late ‘90s and early 2000s, it seemed like it was the golden age for <a href=# rel=nofollow>successful girl groups</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>the top boy bands of all time</a>. After all, groups like the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, and NSYNC were all massively popular and incredibly successful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Meet Machine Gun Kelly's Band</a></span></p><p>On top of the aforementioned three musical teams, there were several other girl groups and boy bands that were very successful, including B2K. Remembered for songs like “Bump Bump Bump,” “Gots Ta Be,” “Girlfriend, “Uh Huh,” and “Why I Love You,” B2K definitely made its mark on music history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/b2k.jpeg><p>Several years after the height of B2K’s success, lead singer Omarion went on to date a woman named Apryl Jones. Together from 2011 through 2016, according to whosdatedwho.com, Omarion and Jones had a son together in 2014 and a daughter in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Omarion and Apryl Jones went their separate ways, she went on to be linked to other notable stars, including Wiz Khalifa, Kevin Durant, and The Game. Then, B2K fans around the world were shocked to learn that Omarion’s ex began dating his former bandmate, Lil’ Fizz.</p><p>If you asked most people to describe what girl code or guy code is, they would instantly know the correct answer. According to both of those widely accepted codes, it is unacceptable for friends to date one another’s exes. With that in mind, it should not surprise anyone that Lil’ Fizz dating Omarion’s ex caused some drama.</p><h2 id=when-did-things-get-messy-between-omarion-lil-rsquo-fizz-and-apryl-jones>When Did Things Get Messy Between Omarion, Lil’ Fizz, and Apryl Jones?</h2><p>After Apryl Jones and Lil’ Fizz became a couple, they both starred in the reality show Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood. While news of their relationship was enough to create a lot of drama among fans, having Jones and Fizz speak about getting married and having kids together took things to a whole new level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/apryl-jones-and-lil-fizz-from-love-and-hip-hop.jpg><p>While a lot of fans were outraged by Lil’ Fizz and Apryl Jones talking about marriage and kids, the third part of the love triangle, Omarion, somehow seemed to take things in stride. In February 2020, Omarion revealed that it was the kids he had with Jones that helped him to keep things in perspective.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I could be acting a damn fool right now</a>, but is that the best thing to do?”</p><p>“Of course having children and just keeping that in perspective and knowing that it’s not all about you that really helped me just maintain my position. You just have to know yourself well enough to know what’s important. And when you do that, things just don’t get in your way. You don’t allow them to.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Apryl Jones and Lil’ Fizz dated for months and continuously faced backlash from a lot of B2K fans, they split up in mid-2020.</p><p>When the former couple came back together for the Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood reunion, Fizz and Jones actually got into a physical altercation, which blew viewers away. Jones later explained that her relationship with Fizz ended because <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he wasn’t a “whole” person</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>A Ranking Of Fan Favorite TV Love Triangles</a></span></p><p>Once he was single, Lil’ Fizz tried to move past all the drama by publicly apologizing to Omarion during a B2K reunion performance. At the time, when Fizz apologized as both men stood on the same stage, Omarion accepted it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/omarion-in-front-of-old-b2k-photo.jfif> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Offstage, however, Omarion puts the blame for his split with Apryl Jones on Lil Fizz. He went so far as to say that the ex-bandmate "destroyed" what he had with Apryl.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">He came over while [Apryl and I were] in a relationship</a>. His invitation to be on Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood and all of that. So that’s why I said it ‘turned up my unbothered’ because I knew it was intentional. Like, ‘what do you get from this? Do you think you won a contest or something?'”</p><p>“What you did was destroy something that—and you know, one apology is not enough.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYqaqpoXqru82eqmakmaF6p7XZs2SappRivK6t0aKmp2WcpMOmedOroJqml6GybsPHmqtmoJGlvaa6xJ1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fapryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fapryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fapryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fapryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fapryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fapryl-jones-lil-fizz-and-omarion-love-triangle-what-happened.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./title-where-the-hell-have-you-been-phillys-most-wanted.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./title-where-the-hell-have-you-been-phillys-most-wanted.html>Where The Hell Have You Been: Philly's Most Wanted</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./timmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html>The Disappearance Of Timmothy Pitzen 10 Years Missing What Actually Happened?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./timmothy-pitzen-disappearance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
