And last night, Nordan worried everyone even more after he went live on Instagram.</p><p>The 24-year-old from Canada is loved by fans for his vlogs and gaming content, but recently people are becoming really worried about him.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=faze-rain-age></span>FaZe Rain Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>FaZe Rain is 24 years old.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shat-tweeted-about-his-depression></span>Shat Tweeted About His Depression<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shat’s drug use was recorded by a follower and uploaded to YouTube, where it has garnered more than 300,000 views. At the 1:20-minute mark, there’s a knock on his door, and two of his friends tell him they’re worried and ask him to get off the live. They also condemned his drug use, reminding him he had underage fans that follow him.</p><p>Shat had been tweeting about feeling depressed for weeks before the Instagram live that worried fans. “I’ve just been feeling this way for years. It’s felt like no way out. I never posted this shit for attention. Just felt I had nowhere to go,” he tweeted on June 7. “The outreach is so heartwarming and I love you all 4L No matter what happens to me don’t forget my message.” The post garnered nearly 50,000 likes from his followers.</p><p>On June 29, he tweeted he had reached “peak depression.”</p><p>The following day he revealed he split with his partner. “My girlfriend’s parents took her from me and won’t let me speak or talk to her in days,” Shat wrote. “I couldn’t stop smiling when I was with her. I just want her back.”</p><p>Currently, he has several Instagram stories up where he talks about splitting from his ex. “Heartbroken as f***,” one message said. Shat claimed he didn’t do anything and that the relationship gave him purpose.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shat-said-he-is-done-with-drugs></span>Shat Said He Is Done With Drugs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CBISz5KFiJt/?utm_source=ig_embed</p><p>The day after his Instagram live, the former FaZe Clan star said he was going to get sober. “NO MORE DRUGS IM DONE,” he wrote on July 1. “ONCE I GET MY APARTMENT AND IM CLEAN, YOU WILL SEE ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE ON EARTH.
