That’s how I know Big Sean was really pissed off at the n-gga when they had their issues.</p><p>“Because I remember just being in the studio and Ye was like, ‘Damn.’ This beat was really fucking with him. He was like, ‘Go head, try to put something together. He called Big Sean, ‘Try to work on this beat as well.
